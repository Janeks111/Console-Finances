# Console-Finances

## Description

I was provided with profit/ loss monthly data for several years and tasked to come up with an algorithm that calculates

the total number of months included in the dataset,

net total amount of Profit/Losses,

average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period,

the greatest increase in profits and the greatest decrease in profit.

The solution for this task is visible in the console.
